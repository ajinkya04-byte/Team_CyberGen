# 🔐 AI-Powered Web Vulnerability Scanner & Auto-Patcher

## 🚀 Overview
This project is an **AI-enhanced web vulnerability scanner** that not only **detects security flaws** but also **automatically generates and applies patches**.  
It integrates seamlessly into a **CI/CD pipeline**, ensuring that insecure code never reaches production.

## ✨ Features
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Scanning** → Detects vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, DDoS, BruteForce, etc.) with improved accuracy.  
- 📊 **Severity Reports** → Classifies issues (Critical, High, Medium, Low) with suggested fixes.  
- 🛠 **Auto-Patching** → Generates and applies security patches automatically.  
- ⚡ **CI/CD Integration** → Runs scans and patches during build & deployment.  
- 📜 **Exportable Reports** → Generates PDF/HTML reports for developers & security teams.  
- 🔄 **Continuous Learning** → Improves detection with feedback loop.

## 🏗️ Architecture
1. **Input**: Source code / Web app / Deployed URL.  
2. **Scanner Engine**: AI + rule-based vulnerability detection.  
3. **Patch Generator**: Creates security patches for detected issues.  
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Automatically applies fixes during pipeline execution.  
5. **Reports Module**: Generates developer- and security-friendly reports.

## 🛠 Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-web-scanner.git
cd ai-web-scanner
pip install -r requirements.txt
For Streamlit UI:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
⚙️ Usage
1. Run Scanner from CLI
bash
Copy
Edit
python scanner.py --url http://example.com
2. Run with Streamlit UI
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Enter website URL

Run vulnerability scan

View severity-based report

Apply auto-patch

3. CI/CD Integration (Example: GitHub Actions)
Add this step to your .github/workflows/main.yml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Run AI Vulnerability Scanner
  run: python scanner.py --url http://localhost:3000
📊 Example Report
Vulnerability: SQL Injection

Severity: High

Suggested Fix: Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation.

Auto-Patch: ✅ Applied successfully.

🔐 Supported Vulnerabilities
SQL Injection (SQLi)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Brute Force Attacks

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

📌 Limitations
AI models may need fine-tuning for new vulnerability patterns.

Auto-patching works for common vulnerabilities, but complex cases may require manual review.

Real-time DDoS prevention requires external infrastructure.
